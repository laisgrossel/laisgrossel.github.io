In this thematic session, we explored two disciplines intrinsically connected to Zoology: Ecology and Animal Behavior. These disciplines, when integrated into Zoology, provided insights into the interactions among organisms and the complexity of biological communities. Ecology, a multidisciplinary science, transcended various fields within the natural sciences. When applied to the study of animals, it focused on analyzing the dynamics, distribution, and behavior of populations and communities, as well as the interactions between animals and their environments. In the first part of this thematic session, we examined ecological aspects, emphasizing their relevance in zoological research. The interconnection among different ecosystem components was explored, highlighting how ecology played a fundamental role in understanding the patterns and processes that shape animal life. The second part of the session focused on Animal Behavior, defined as the internally coordinated responses of organisms to internal or external stimuli, excluding responses related to development. We addressed Tinbergen’s four questions—foundational in behavioral studies—and explored the various applications of this science in understanding reproductive, parental, social, foraging, defensive, and communicative behaviors across the diversity of animal groups. By combining the principles of ecology with the intricate nuances of animal behavior, we aimed to provide a solid foundation for zoological research, highlighting the interdisciplinarity required for a holistic understanding of biological diversity.<br>
